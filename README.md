## Paper's abstract 
In Internet of things (IoT), high-dimensional time series data is continuously generated and recorded from different data sources and these time series are characterized by intrinsic changes known as concept drifts. Beside, decision-making in IoT applications may often involve multiple factors and criteria. Therefore, methods that are capable of handling high-dimensional non-stationary time series and multiple outputs are of great value in IoT applications. We present a new methodology to forecasting high-dimensional non-stationary time series called MO-ENSFTS (Multiple Output Embedding Non-Stationary Fuzzy Time Series). MO-ENSFTS is a first-order multivariate model which is classified as a multiple input/output forecaster. We apply a combination of data embedding transformation and Fuzzy Time Series (FTS) model, and our proposed methodology was tested on four real-world high-dimensional IoT data sets. The proposed approach is a data-driven method which is flexible and adaptable for many IoT applications, and the experiments results demonstrate that our methodology outperform several machine learning methods.
